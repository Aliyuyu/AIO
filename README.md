## Features

The Forza Mods Tool is packed full of features:

(For Steam FH4, only garage/autoshow and stat editor tab will work)

### Autoshow

No longer will you have to worry about finding id's and swapping them, or even going through each car to get the thumbnail back, this does it all for you!
* All Cars Filter - Show every car in the autoshow ready for purchase
* Rare Cars Filter - Only show cars that you cant usualy buy from the autoshow, in the autoshow
* Null Car - Shows only the NULL car in the autoshow
* Paint Lego Cars - Allows you to apply special paint to Lego cars
* Remove Any Car - Allows you to use the "Remove from garage" option on any car
* Unlock Details - Reveals hidden paint decals 
* Free Cars - Makes all cars in the autoshow free
* ~~Series X|S Fix - Fixes bug that made them infinite load~~ - MS fixed after we implemented it
* Show Traffic and HS Cars - Allows them to be bought
* Fix Thumbnails - Fixes thumbs
* Unlock Hidden Presets - Unlocks hidden Upgrade Presets
* Clear Garage - PERMENANTLY deletes all cars from your garage
* [Add all cars](https://streamable.com/li2379) - Literally gives you all un-owned released cars in the game in one click


### Stats

This tool also allows you to tweak in game stats, such as hidden settings, controller preferences, and values for your stat page.   
It isn't perfect however so you can't currently expect all of the stats show to either 1. Be the right value, or 2. Stick once you change it.
You can give yourself max CR and add skill points with stats, to find out how, join the discord server, and check pins in the forza chat.

### SaveSwapping

No longer do you have to get scammed by people SeLlInG mOdDeD aCcOuNtS or even faff about by going through your game directories. This lets you backup your saves and swap them with saves made by the lovely people in our discord (the same ones these scammers use, they steal them from us)

### Tuning

Another unique feature we have is the live tuning, it allows you to manage all options in the tuning tab without having to go to said tab for each adjustment.
It also allows you to change the values to outside what can normally be set, e.g. -15° of camber!

### Cool

This is where most of the gameplay changing mods are, these include:
* Wheelspeed Speed Hack and Turn Assist - As seen in my UnknownCheats post
* Velocity Speed Hack - The more ridiculous kind of speed hack
* Jump hack - Fly and shit
* No Clip - Both wall, and car
* Gravity and (weird) Acceleration Hack - Go flying, or stick to the ground
* Super Brake - Instantly stop
* Super Car - Speedhack like you have never seen before
* Teleport List and Auto TP To Waypoint - Teleport to a list of set destinations, or teleport to your waypoint (faster that fast travel)
* Manual Time - Adjust time forward or back with numpad 4 and 6, quicker with shift held
* Xp Mod - Give yourself as much XP as you want, even reset to 0 if you so wish
* Bypass Out Of Bounds - Swim in the ocean or just leave england without getting teleported back
* 0-60 Timing - Time your 0-60's and log them to a file
* FoV Changing - Get insane Fields of view
* Discover All Roads - Discovers all roads for you
* Stop Water Drag - Drive through water without slowing down
* Skip Intro - Make the intro just black with no audio
* Freeze AI - Freezes offline drivatars
* Clothes Unlocker - Lets you equip any locked clothing item
* Emote Unlocker - Lets you equip any locked emote
